 Description:-

	Device Object Application is the device protocol based application.


 Features:-

	* Handles a single protocol at a time.
	* Automatically connects/reconnects with the cloud application in the mesh.

	* Loads the protocol at the start up, according to the configuration.

	* Has the capability to broadcast device data through out the mesh.
	* Due to the fixed interface, it receives requests from both mesh applications and cloud applications in the same way.
	* Shadow Controller is able to differentiate the requests sent from applications and cloud. Based on this, it is able to generate blobs and store those blobs.	
	* When an application sends the request shadow controller is able to notify cloud and upon completion notifies the source application as well as the cloud.
	* Shadow Controller maintains the In Progress queue.
	* Most of the exceptions are handled and concerning source application is notified be it cloud or in mesh application.

	* Due to less support from cloud shadow controller, the gateway shadow controller multiple properties setting feature is at the moment disabled. 
	* Some sections of the code can be simplified such as parsing topics, cloud connectivity section can be made into a separate section.  
	* Commenting can be improved.
	* Persistent storage.
	* Dynamic MQTT topic configuration is left out.
